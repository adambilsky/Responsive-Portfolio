      <p>Welcome to my website! It’s been a long time since I first learned to code in 1984 with Apple’s Turtle Logo and tried to write my own text adventure games in Basic on an Apple IIe.  I completed a BS in Education at Northwestern in the days of Netscape, and I first joined Facebook while in grad school at DePaul, where I completed an MS in Public Service Management.<br><br> My career in youth services and education helped teach me to be resilient, and that I could teach myself just about anything, from budgeting and data analysis in Excel to volleyball coaching student council management, so I’m excited to share my work here as I learn.<br> <br>When I manage to leave the house, I find myself in Deerfield, Illinois.</p>
